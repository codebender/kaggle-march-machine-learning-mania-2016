Back for its third year, March Machine Learning Mania challenges data scientists to predict winners and losers of the men's 2016 NCAA basketball tournament.

In stage one of this two-stage competition, participants will build and test their models against the previous four tournaments. In the second stage, participants will predict the outcome of the 2016 tournament. You don’t need to participate in the first stage to enter the second. The first stage exists to incentivize model building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition is forecasting the 2016 results.
